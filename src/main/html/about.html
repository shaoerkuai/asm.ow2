    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>The ASM project was created by Eric Bruneton in 2000, during his PhD at
    <a href="http://www.inria.fr/">INRIA</a>. At that time it was only a code
    generator (no ClassReader, no Visitor concept). It was used to generate
    dynamic stub and proxy classes, before the
    <code>java.lang.reflect.Proxy</code> class was released in JDK 1.3. These
    dynamic classes were used to transparently add non functional properties
    (logging, persistence, replication, etc) to user components.</p>
    <p>The visitor idea and the ClassReader concepts were added later, in order
    to be able to transform existing classes. This was needed to insert the non
    functional code directly in the user classes, instead of in an intermediate
    proxy (for better performance). These new features were designed and
    implemented by Eric Bruneton after his PhD, at France Telecom R&amp;D (now
    Orange Labs), in order to implement the <a href=
    "http://fractal.ow2.org/">Fractal component model</a>.</p>
    <p>The ASM project was released in Open Source in 2002, at the same time as
    the Fractal project. Since then, many external contributions have been done
    to the project. The most important contributors are now part of the ASM
    team, namely Eugene Kuleshov (since 2003), Andrei Loskutov (since 2004) and
    RÃ©mi Forax (since 2008).</p>
